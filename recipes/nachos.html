    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This Mexican potato nachos recipe is so good, 
        and it's great for a potluck. For a little more 
        kick, try pepper Jack cheese in place of Cheddar.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 large baking potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>8 ounces ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons taco seasoning</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>1 small tomato, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>¼ cup guacamole</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil to a large bowl. Add potato slices to the bowl; toss to coat in oil.</li>
        <li>Arrange potato slices in a single layer on a baking sheet; sprinkle with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potato slices are golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; add ground beef. Brown, breaking into crumbles as it cooks, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>Stir black beans into ground beef, then stir in taco seasoning and water. Bring beef-bean mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until flavors have blended, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Arrange potato slices on a serving platter; sprinkle with 1/2 Cheddar cheese. Top with meat-bean mixture; sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cheese.</li>
        <li>Spread lettuce over nachos; garnish with tomato. Dollop on sour cream and guacamole.</li>
    </ol>
